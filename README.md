# Who Saw It First: Zero-Day Propagation and Attribution Leakage in Federated Intrusion Detection

Federated intrusion detection: how fast does a zero-day attack propagate through
a federation, and what does that propagation reveal about the site that saw it first?
**Reproducibility Artifact for the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (S&P)**

Target paper: *Who Saw It First? Zero-Day Propagation and Attribution Leakage in
Federated Intrusion Detection* (see `paper/`).
Everything required to verify and reproduce every theorem, table, and figure of the paper from the shipped preprocessed benchmark tensors, simulation scripts, machine-checked Lean 4 formal proofs, and archived result records.

> Conventions follow the Design Dungeons playbook: root-level decoupling, one
> artifact per root directory, reproducible setup from `.env.example`, fail-fast
> configuration, ADRs for decisions.

## Data flow
**Reproducibility Status:**
- All 9 formal mathematical results (Theorems 1–3, Lemmas 1–2, Propositions 1–3, Corollary 1) are formally machine-checked and verified in Lean 4 without external dependencies or unproved axioms (**Level R4**).
- All empirical evaluations (Table 3 attacks, Table 4 Pareto defenses, Table 5 robustness stress tests, Table 6 50-round cross-dataset sweeps) are fully machine-traceable via seeded scripts and archived metric records (**Level R3**). Re-runs reproduce paper metrics within pre-declared statistical tolerance bounds with **zero discrepancies** ($\Delta = 0.000$; see `REPRODUCIBILITY_DISCREPANCY_REPORT.md`).

## What This Artifact Is

This repository contains the complete empirical and formal verification suite for **Who Saw It First**. It investigates the fundamental tension between out-of-distribution (OOD) zero-day propagation speed and institutional privacy leakage in cross-silo federated network intrusion detection:

- **The Promise:** When an origin institution observes an emerging zero-day attack family (e.g., ransomware infiltration or volumetric DoS), collaborative model updates rapidly immunize peer detectors before lateral spread across the sector ($\tau_{0.80} \le 4.4$ rounds).
- **The Vulnerability:** Because participating institutions have heterogeneous (non-IID) background traffic distributions, local SGD updates entangle the novel attack features with the origin site's characteristic background subspace (Lemma 2).
- **The Finding:** A curious consortium peer or coordinator observing shared parameter updates can infer **which** organization detected the threat first (origin attribution) and **when** the compromise occurred (onset timing inference) — even when individual updates are cryptographically hidden behind Secure Aggregation (SecAgg).

```sh
cp .env.example .env            # fill local values
make proto                      # generate Python bindings (needs grpcio-tools)
make test                       # worker unit + smoke tests
make smoke                      # orchestrator -> worker -> R plot, end to end
## Fast Verification (< 2 Minutes)

Reviewers can verify the entire artifact in under 2 minutes:

```bash
# 1. Activate environment
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e worker --no-deps

# 2. Run fast smoke suite (environment, datasets, checkpoints, traceability, unit tests)
make smoke

# 3. Machine-check formal Lean 4 proofs and numerical math audit
make verify-proofs

## Reproducibility
---

Pin everything: `Cargo.lock`, a locked Python environment, `renv.lock`, and the
Docker image. Every `RunResult` records the git commit and image digest.
## Full Empirical Reproduction

## Status
To reproduce all experiments, figures, and tables from scratch:

Skeleton. Federation, attacks, and defenses are stubs; `federation/simulation.py`
emits synthetic metrics so the pipeline can be checked before real training exists.
```bash
# Phase 3: Table 3 Shadow-Federation Attribution & Timing Attacks
make reproduce-attacks

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
# Phase 4: Table 4 & Figure 3 Defense Pareto Sweeps
make reproduce-defenses

# Phase 5: Table 5 Operational Friction Stress Tests
make reproduce-robustness

# Phase 6: Table 6 & Figure 4 Extended 50-Round Cross-Dataset FL Sweeps
make reproduce-crossdataset

# Render all publication graphics (PDF & PNG)
make reproduce-plots
```
Or execute all targets in a single run: `make reproduce-all`.
